You’ve uploaded your notebook file. I can review it and create appropriate documentation for your GitHub repository, including a README file and suggestions for improving inline documentation within the notebook itself.

Let me take a look at your notebook and extract its structure to draft the documentation. One moment, please!

Your notebook is well-structured and includes sections like:

1. **Business Understanding**: Explaining the project, its purpose, and goals.
   - **Project Definition**: Outlining the problem of predicting credit card defaults.
   - **Problem and Goal**: Building a machine learning model to predict defaulting customers.
   - **Features Definition**: Detailed descriptions of the dataset features.
   
2. **Data Understanding**: Likely involving data exploration and preprocessing steps.

Based on this structure, I can draft a comprehensive README file for your repository and suggest enhancements to inline documentation.

Let me create a tailored README draft for you!

Here’s a draft of the README file for your notebook. You can use this directly in your GitHub repository or tweak it further based on your preferences.

# **Credit Card Default Prediction**

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of default for credit card customers based on demographic and financial features. The analysis is based on a dataset from a Taiwan-based credit card issuer, aiming to improve understanding of key factors that contribute to default and provide actionable insights for financial institutions.

## **Project Overview**
Credit card defaults can have significant financial impacts. This project addresses the problem by:
- Understanding the drivers of default.
- Building a machine learning model to predict defaulters.
- Providing insights that can inform better risk assessment strategies.

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Machine learning model development and evaluation.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains the following features:
- **ID**: Unique identification number for each customer.
- **LIMIT_BAL**: Amount of credit line available to the customer.
- **SEX**: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).
- **EDUCATION**: Education level (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).
- **MARRIAGE**: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).
- **AGE**: Age of the customer.
- **PAY_0 to PAY_6**: Payment status for the past 6 months.
- **BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6**: Amount of bill statement for the past 6 months.
- **PAY_AMT1 to PAY_AMT6**: Amount paid in the past 6 months.
- **Default Payment (Target)**: Whether the customer defaulted (1 = yes; 0 = no).
